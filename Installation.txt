Installation is a bit awkward from inside MSVS, i.e. you can't do it. 

You have to follow the instructions from https://nazca-design.org/installation/
and use the Anaconda prompt to install the package. 

Confirm the installation using the pip show command as instructed to find
'path-to-nazca'

To ensure that the code can be used from inside MSVS you then have to ensure MSVS can see 
where the code is installed

# Include this command inside your code to make sure that MSVS can see the code
# If you add the 'path-to-nazca' to the MSVS search paths it can also find it
sys.path.append('path-to-nazca')

You also need to install the following packages to ensure it runs without errors
Babel
pywin32
